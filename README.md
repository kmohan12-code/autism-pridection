# Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to develop a binary classification model for screening Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in adults. By analyzing various attributes related to individuals, the model predicts the likelihood of a person being diagnosed with ASD. Early diagnosis is crucial as it can significantly reduce healthcare costs and improve outcomes for individuals.

## Background
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that poses significant challenges to individuals and their families. The increasing prevalence of ASD worldwide highlights the urgent need for effective and accessible screening methods. Traditional diagnostic processes can be lengthy and costly, making timely intervention difficult. This project seeks to address these challenges through the application of machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the **Autistic Spectrum Disorder Screening Data for Adults**, which includes:

- **Number of Instances**: 704
- **Number of Attributes**: 21
- **Data Types**: Categorical, continuous, and binary attributes.
- **Missing Values**: Yes

### Features
The dataset contains 20 features, including:
- **AQ-10 Adult Behavioral Features**: Ten behavioral traits known to be effective in detecting ASD.
- **Individual Characteristics**: Ten demographic and personal characteristics.
